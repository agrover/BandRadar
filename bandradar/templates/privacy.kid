    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
    BandRadar intentionally limits the amount of personal information it collects
    to that which it needs to provide its service. We will not expose email addresses
    or other information to anyone else without explicit permission from you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    We are still working on a formal privacy policy, but it will follow the
    informal guidelines above.
