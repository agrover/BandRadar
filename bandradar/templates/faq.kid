    <title>BandRadar - FAQ</title>

  <h2> Why only Portland Shows?</h2>

<p>Current trends dictate that web-based tracking sites cover the globe, meaning only the most popular venues, bands, or events get coverage.  At BandRadar we think in these days of information quantity it's time for a little quality.  Plus we live in Portland, and want to support the live music scene and that means making sure local bands and small venues with an active music scene have equal listings.  Someday we will expand – but only when the site is packed with quality information, and usable features for Portland music lovers.
</p>

<h2>Why no ads?</h2>

<p>We are getting a little bit tired of searching for content amongst the Adsense and AdBanners, and flashing doo-dah's.  We think it should be easy to access information – without wading through commercials. Eventually, we are going to need to seek some sponsors, but we promise the acknowledgments will be tasteful and hopefully informative.</p>

<h2>What's with the design?</h2>
<p>The concept is of a live music show poster.  Sort of like the olden days. Eventually we plan to reve the site design every few months – with a new poster style.  Maybe even hold a design contest.  
</p>
<h2>How is BandRadar different from MySpace?</h2>

<p>BandRadar is not a social site.  We are a site for tracking live music.  Reviews are on our upcoming feature list – but by "reputable" authors.  Our goal is to provide QUALITY information about the Portland, OR music scene.  We may add a rating or recommendation system, but once again it will be controlled for quality content.</p>

<h2>Can I write whatever I want when I add a band or venue?
</h2>
<p>Each update is logged and reviewed.  Your posts may be edited or in extreme cases deleted if they contain gratuitous profanity, racist, sexist, or homophobic content. BandRadar is a privately run site and we reserve the right to control what sort of content is included.  We want music lovers of all genres to feel welcome.  
</p>
<h2>Why does the site look a little funny in my non-Firefox browser?</h2>

<p>BandRadar is designed to be a standards-compliant website.  We tested as much as possible in alternative browsers.  We are advocates of OpenSource Software and our design and development follows those principles.  Which means things might look funny in proprietary browsers, like um...MS Internet Explorer.  
</p>
<h2>Why is there no OpenID support?</h2>

<p>Guess what! OpenID support is on the feature list to be rolled out shortly.</p>
